# bitpat

This is a collection of utility functions to manipulate bits in integer type numbers.

## Build Instructions

The code includes some unit-tests using the
[criterion](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) testing library.

```
make
make test
```

## Notes

At this point, the collection of adt's are not made into a library, but this would be a natural
next step. The code is documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) 
style tags.
